### Description

Javascript application to identify user's age on various planets in Earth's solar system based on birthdate and current date. Because each planet in the solar system carries a different solar year length, meaning that Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter are a length of 1, .24, .62, 1.88, and 11.86 Earth years long respectively. This application tells the user how 'old' they are on each of these planets, and how their age relates to their particular life expectancy calculated by planet year length.

#### Program behavior specifications:
| Behavior | Input | Output |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Application returns user’s current age | (User's birthday year, month, and day) 1989, 10, 22 | 29 |
| Application returns user’s current age in Mercury years | 1989, 10, 22 | 122 |
| Application returns user’s current age in Venus years | 1989, 10, 22 | 47 |
| Application returns user’s current age in Mars years | 1989, 10, 22 | 15 |
| Application returns user’s current age in Jupiter years | 1989, 10, 22 | 2 |
| Application returns user’s life expectancy for all planets | (User's birthday year, month, day, & life expectancy on Earth for user’s particular demographic) 1989, 10, 22, 75 | Current life expectancy divided by .24,  .62, 1.88, and 11.86 for Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter respectively. |
| Application returns the difference between user age and life expectancy for all planets (if positive) | 2019, 10, 22, 75 | 'You have 45 years left to live on Earth, 190 years left to live on Mercury, 73 years left to live on Venus, 24 years left to live on Mars, and 4 years left to live on Jupiter...' |
| Application returns exceeded age expectancy for all planets (if difference is positive) | 1899, 10, 22, 75 | 'You have exceeded your life expectancy by 45 Earth years, 185 Mercury years, 72 Venus years, 24 Mars years, and 4 Jupiter years...' |
