### Description

<!-- Example website design based on fictional co-working space client. Assignment was to build a website based on fictional set of client-desires for branding. This web page was built to practice wireframing, responsive design, and implementing grids and flexboxes. -->

#### Program behavior specifications:
| Behavior | Input | Output |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Application returns user’s current age | User's birthday | User's current Earth age |
| Application returns user’s current age in Mercury years | User's birthday | current age divided by .24 |
| Application returns user’s current age in Venus years | User's birthday | Current age divided by .62 |
| Application returns user’s current age in Mars years | User's birthday | current age divided by 1.88 |
| Application returns user’s current age in Jupiter years | User's birthday | current age divided by 11.86 |
| Application returns user’s life expectancy for all planets | User's birthday & life expectancy on Earth for user’s particular demographic | Current life expectancy divided by .24,  .62, 1.88, and 11.86 for Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter respectively. |

### Technologies and Resources

* HTML
* SASS
* Webpack
* npm

<!-- ### Responsiveness

This website is responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. A custom stacked menu will appear at the top of this website below the banner image at 739 pixel viewport width and below. All other content will also rearrange itself to fit the viewport as it narrows. -->

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository at https://github.com/SlaterJamesSmith/galactic-age-calc
2. Use a terminal of your choice to access the webpage and its files by inputting: "git clone {the above clone link}"
3. If homebrew is not yet installed on your Mac, install it by running the following command in your terminal: "$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
4. If you are not using a Mac, and homebrew is not yet installed, go to the node website and follow appropriate installer for your operating system at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
5. In terminal, enter "$ npm i" to install node package manager
6. In terminal, navigate into project by entering enter "$ cd co-working-project"
7. Next, in terminal enter "$ npm run start" and a new web browser window should load with the url "localhost:8080"


### Roadmap & Known Bugs
<!-- This application still needs work before it can be considered complete. It still needs:
* Text/font styling to match wireframes
* Banner image change upon switch to "tablet" and "mobile" views to reflect wireframe prototypes
* Active links to additional pages
* In "tablet" and "mobile" views a glitch occurs when the user scrolls to the right; a large empty margin appears when this happens. This will need to be fixed for the final version. -->
